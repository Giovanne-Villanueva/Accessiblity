# Website Code Refactoring

## Description

I was inspired to put my new skills of HTML and CSS styling to the test. A marketing agencey presented me with a webpage that needed some refactoring. The company's webpage was for Horiseon and it was a functional website. I learned to follow the html program and add comments to help others follow along. The header in each divison or section clearly states what is described in the section. Then I learned to add descriptions to the images in case the images fails to load. Each section in the HTML follows a sequential order of elements. The CSS file taught me a way to style the webpage. There were parts of the css code that I reuse to reduce redundancy in the program.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The Horiseon webpage is just a webpage with info provided by Horiseon. The header of the webpage has a clickable attruibute that takes users to specific topics in the webpage. If you look at the HTML file you can see comments breaking down the different sections of HTML code. The images have a description now.
